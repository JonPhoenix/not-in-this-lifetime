# Responsive Portfolio Project

This is a mobile responsive application that combines basic knowledge on HTML, CSS and GIT with the CSS framework Bootstrap. Created by developers at Twitter, Bootstrap is one of the most widely used in production, a strong open source to design applications using its grid system structure of rows and columns.

Starting with a basic structure of index, portfolio and contact webpages, this responsive application delivers an extended structure of a home page, about page, two portfolio galleries and a contact page with functional social media links.

The featured theme was chosen to deliver a better experience navigating the mobile application using a real subject, with a creative twist, atractive images, and a bit of story-telling. This project is a first experiment in the process of building a future web developper portfolio.
