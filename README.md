# Responsive Portfolio Project

This mobile responsive application combines basic knowledge on HTML, CSS, GIT, Scripts, and the CSS framework Bootstrap. Created by developers at Twitter, Bootstrap is one of the most widely used frameworks in production, it is a strong open source to build applications using a grid system based on rows and columns.

Starting with index, portfolio and contact pages, this responsive application delivers an extended structure comprised by home, about, portfolio galleries, and contact pages, including functional links to social media.

The webpage theme was chosen to deliver a better experience when navigating the mobile application, it features a creative twist, atractive images, and a bit of *story-telling.* This project is a first prototype in the process of building a web-developer portfolio.

## Using Bootstrap Components

This application was built using containers, rows and columns. The entire layout has Bootstrap components such as a navigation bar on every page, links to the website sections, and page design exploiting the "card" component to build a consistent look and feel.

The home page uses a Jumbotron unit for the project intro, a mosaic of images built with rows, columns, sub-rows and sub-columns. Inside, the gallery sections are organized using a 4-column row segment structure, and the contact page is a form made of simple formgroups.
