# Responsive Portfolio Project

This is a mobile responsive application that combines basic knowledge on HTML, CSS and GIT with the CSS framework Bootstrap and some Scripts. Created by developers at Twitter, Bootstrap is one of the most widely used in production, a strong open source to design applications using its grid system structure of rows and columns.

Starting with a basic structure of index, portfolio and contact webpages, this responsive application delivers an extended structure of a home page, about page, two portfolio galleries and a contact page with functional social media links.

The featured theme was chosen to deliver a better experience navigating the mobile application featuring a real subject, with a creative twist, atractive images, and a bit of *story-telling.* This project is a first experiment in the process of building a future web developer portfolio.

## Using Bootstrap Components

The portfolio application was built using containers, rows and columns. The entire layout has Bootstrap components such as a navigation bar at the top of every page with links to the website sections, an elegant page design exploiting the "card" component to build an clean and consistent look and feel across sections.

The home page uses a Jumbotron hero unit featuring a project intro with a mosaic of images made with rows, columns, sub-rows and sub-columns. Inside, the gallery sections are organized with 4-column row segments and the contact page uses a form component with simple formgroups.
